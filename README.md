This is a simple Text-to-Speech (TTS) application built using Python and the `kokoro` library. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) built with `tkinter` that allows users to convert text into speech using various voices. The application supports saving the generated audio to `.wav` files, selecting different voices, and customizing output filenames and directories.

```bash
uv run main.py # Takes some time to start
